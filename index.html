      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Regan has been involved in teaching and editing for over 30 years. She
        started her career in Japan teaching English to businessmen and editing
        English textbooks targeted at teaching businessmen. She later moved to
        France where she wrote for Boulevard magazine and worked as a freelance
        translator from French to English. More recently, she has donated her
        work as a tutor, counselor and editor to underserved minority
        communities in East Harlem, NY.

        The college application process can be overwhelming -- testing, essays,
        recommendations, early admissions, early action, binding, non-binding.
        It can feel like a foreign language within a foreign language. <br />
        We are here to decode it for you. We are here to virtually hold your
        hand through the process and most importantly to guide your student to
        the best application they can put forward. From choosing a` la carte for
        help with a single essay to working with our staff to determine school
        choice, test timing and completion of all your college applications, we
        are here to help your student transition from high school to university
        with the greatest success possible. <br />
        Through a combination of on-line meetings (Skype, Google Chat, FaceTime,
        WhatsApp) and document exchanges we will assist your student in
        organizing their thoughts to whittle down and settle on an essay topic.
        From there we will work with them as they craft and shape an essay that
        reflects their unique voice and passion. <br />
        One of the trickiest parts of creating that perfect essay is saying what
        you want to say in the precise number of characters or words allotted.
        We will help you cut or add to your essays until they are exactly the
        right length. <br />
        For many families deciphering the various applications (financial aid,
        TOEFL, SAT, ACT, etc) can be mind-numbing. We can take that job off your
        plate to give you and your student the opportunity to focus on the
        critical tasks of test preparation and essay writing.

              We can assist with all the essays on the application. According to
              college admissions officers, the short-answer essays can be even
              more important than the personal essay. Don’t dash them off, take
              the time to write a thoughtful response and have it professionally
              edited as you did with the personal essay.

              deadlines (early decision, early decision II, early action,
              rolling admissions) as a compliment to their high school college

            <ul>
              These are big decisions. Some students like to hear more than one

              Our goal is the ultimate success of your student. We want to see
              your student in the best college or university that fits their
              profile. Setting them up for success requires that they be
              prepared for the rigors of their chosen school and confident in
              their ability to succeed. That starts with first and foremost
              their high school transcript. It continues with their standardized
              testing and culminates in their personal essays and applications.
            </ul>
            <li>
              We will reach out to the student if we haven’t heard from them at
              the appointed time and we will then reach out to you, the parents.
              But we can-not make your students do the work.
            </li>
            <li>
              This is not a translation service. We want your student to be
              prepared for the university experience and being able to work in
              English is a big part of that.

            One complete college application includes personal essay,

            school’s programs and how they gel with the student’s desires. They
            require the student and editor to think more deeply about how they
            would fit in at each prospective school both intellectually and

            Starting in the summer between sophomore and junior years (4th and
            5th years), we are available to strategize for the most efficient
            scheduling of testing, and start to think about what types of
            universities might be in your student’s future.
            <br />
            Discussions will include academic rigor, field of study, geographic
            location, size, and demographics.

            Scheduling and applications for all testing: TOEFEL, SAT, SAT2, ACT
          </p>
          <p>
            As the junior (5th) year continues we will start to brainstorm
            personal essay topics and to discuss the application schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
            As testing is on-going the essay writing will begin in earnest the
            summer between junior and senior ( 5th and 6th) year. (or more
            definitively August of your 6th year when the Common Application
            comes out). Editing and crafting services on up to SIX applications
